# anytools
Very small tools for specific or not tasks, just not to loose solution attempt.

## diffc.sh
Diff changes of C/C++ project folder, only diffs scr files existing in both folders.

## codeblockstranslator.sh
Translating (i18n) script for codeblocks. Rewritten from Windows one.

## get_files_from_out.sh
Need to get binary file from somewhere, but has access only to stdout?

Use tags:

	<FILE_BASE64 <filename>> 
	<base64 of the file>
	</FILE_BASE64>

The script will decode base64 stream to binary, keeping other lines intact.
